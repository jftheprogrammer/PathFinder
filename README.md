# PathFinder
This tool visualizes various pathfinding algorithms such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), and A* Search. Set a start and end point, place walls, and add weights to cells to simulate different terrains. Use the step-by-step visualization to see how each algorithm progresses.3
